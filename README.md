# gemau

The first seed of what will hopefully be a computer algebra system for CGT.

The current goal of this crate is to provide first-class support for partizan
mis√®re research. At present, it contains only functionality for studying Left
dead ends, but this will soon increase. In the long term, this crate will also
aim to serve more traditional use cases, like normal play.

## Examples

```rust
use gemau::LeftDeadEnd;

let g = LeftDeadEnd::waiting(4);
let h = g + 2;

// factors are 0, 1, 2, W_4, 1 + W_4, 2 + W_4
assert_eq!(h.factors().len(), 6);

let k = LeftDeadEnd::with_options(3..7);
assert_eq!(k.flex(), 1);
assert_eq!(k.race(), 4);
assert_eq!(k.birth(), 7);

let j = LeftDeadEnd::waiting(3);
let k = k + j;
assert_eq!(k.flex(), 9);
assert_eq!(k.race(), 5);
assert_eq!(k.birth(), 10);
```

If you want the crate to be finished quicker, then you could consider
contributing. :)
